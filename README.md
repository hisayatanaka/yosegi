# Yosegi

Starter package for building web applications based on "Riot.js".

## Features

* Setup Riot.js based WAF with simple commands.
* Implement development styles like Web components.
* ES6 compatible (Automatic trans-pile to ES5 with Babel).
* Supports Sass syntax (also available within Riot tag).
* Browser auto reloading (watching files with Browsersync).
* Automatically compile and bundle using Webpack (also minifying).

## Requirement

* nodejs
* Sass
* Compass

## Getting started

If you can use "docker-compose" in your project.  
Execute the following commands.

```
$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up --build
```

The docker is auto starting Yosegi modules.  
If you keep the standard settings, you can access it with the following URL.

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Only this.

## Getting setup it manually

But if you would like to set it manually.  

Move to the cloned directory.   
Execute the following commands.

```
$ npm install
```

### Usage

First you need to start the browsersync http server and commpass watch.  
Please execute the following commands (reccomend use tmux or screen).

```
$ compass watch (or compass compile)
$ npm start
```

Browsersync will now start http server.  
If you keep the standard settings, you can access it with the following URL.

```
http://localhost:3000
```

1. If you using a remote server, replace localhost.
2. It is necessary to open port 3000ã€€(and optional UI port 3001 too).

If you using a local server, current browser will open automatically.  
But if using a remote server, Browsersync say "Couldn't open browser" error. In that case please access the URL manually (Even in that case, the automatically reload will work normally).

## In Case of dedicated http server (ex. Nginx)

Browsersync has "proxy" option.  

#### bs-config.js

```js:bs-config.js
"proxy": {
  target: "127.0.0.1:80",
  ws: true
},
```
_See also [Browsersync options](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options#option-proxy)._

Connected to nginx via proxy, 
It is also possible to connect to another socket server through different port numbers (ex. 8080). This is useful for development using golang, for example.

## Setup sample for Google Compute Engine

1. Create a new instance with CentOS.
2. Add release of ports 3000 and 3001 to GCE 's network rule. 
3. Connect to SSH prompto on browser.
4. Exucute following `yum install` commands.
5. Please install Yosegi (clone and npm install).
6. Start the server (compass compile and npm start).
7. Access `http://[External IP]:3000`.
8. Enjoy!

```
$ sudo yum install git
$ sudo yum install epel-release
